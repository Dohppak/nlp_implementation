# NLP paper implementation with PyTorch
The papers were implemented in using korean corpus 

### Classification
+ Using the [Naver sentiment movie corpus v1.0](https://github.com/e9t/nsmc)
+ Hyper-parameter was arbitrarily selected. (epoch: 5, mini_batch: 128, except KoBERT (epoch: 2, mini_batch: 32))
